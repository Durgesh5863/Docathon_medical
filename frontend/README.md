This folder will contain the user interface for the Alzheimer's Risk Prediction prototype. The web app will allow users to upload audio (and in the future, eye tracking) data, view risk predictions, and receive explanations.

## Getting Started

1. Install frontend dependencies (see instructions to be added).
2. Start the development server to preview the app.

UI framework and implementation details will be added in subsequent steps.
