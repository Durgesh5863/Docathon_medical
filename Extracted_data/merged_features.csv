I felt that it was a bit of a sanitized version of  What police work was having been incarcerated myself on a number of occasions always through false accusations misunderstanding.  So when I came on the first character that I introduced was a character named Sal benedetto, who was a bad cop? Who was always beating up Charlie Haden and so on who seemed to me to be a more accurate representation of at least, one aspect of policing and he wined up the bank and they send the robot in. He, he, he was hiding in the vault and they sent a robot in so they can watch what he's doing. And he starts beating a robot with his fists and let, you know, he's a kind of unreconstructed is a Luddite, you know, he hates technology. Anyway, in those days, you couldn't have such a cop as a regular, and they made me kill him. But then several years later, I was put in charge of the show. And so I brought the character back as Bunch this guy."
